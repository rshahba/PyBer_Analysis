# PyBer_Analysis
Analyze the rideshare data from January to early May of 2019.

## Overview of Project
This project focuses on a performatory analysis on PyBer ridesharing data by creating several types of visualizations to tell a compelling story about the data to showcase the relationship between the type of city, and the number of drivers and riders. 

### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to improve access to ride-sharing services and determine affordability for underserved neighbourhoods.

## Results
The data indicates that urban regions generate the highest fares from January to late April in 2019. By observing the total number of drivers in each region, drivers in the rural regions are compensated 3.35 times higher on average than of those in urban regions. This highlights the possibility that revenue from the total fares in urban regions are whats compensating for the high rates of drivers fees in rural regions as the generated average fare is less than the average fare per driver .

Additionally, by plotting our results we are able to see an upward trend from January to March, however the total fare value fluctuates aggressively in urban areas. There lies a huge opportunity to take a look at the socioeconomic factors such as Spring break. It could also be argued that the sharp drop in the last week of February also holds the opportunity be looked at more closely.

## Summary

To harness the opportunity of growing PyBer in rural areas, it is recommended to increase the number of drivers by implementing a "Bring a Friend" referal program where riders will receive a credit for signing up other drivers.

In addition, the primary means of commute in rural regions could be studied to launch competetive campaigns such as discounting fares at certain hours or perhaps a points system incentive where the customers are rewarded with a point after every ride.

To better manage peak times such as the end of April in suburban regions and to avoid losing the cutomers to the competitor it is highly recommended to launch a "wait and save" feature where the customers are given the option to wait a for a driver to become available for a  disounted ride.
